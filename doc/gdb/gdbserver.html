<h1>gdbserver is small and running on the target, while gdb on host</h1>
<pre>
<hr>
target&gt;gdbserver /dev/com1 niceprint "hello world"
target&gt;gdbserver host:2345 niceprint "hello world"
<hr>
host&gt;gdb niceprint
(gdb) target remote myhost:2345
0x00... in func() from /lib64/ld-linux-x86_64.so.2

<p>
GDB RSP(Remote Serial Protocol) points that the target must act as a server.
<br>
If there is a new arch-target and you want debug program running on it with gdb, you should port gdb server to it.
<br>
RSP is a high level protocol which based on TCP|UDP|Serial|Other, which based on Operation System! So it can debug any remote target.
